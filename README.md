# Side channel leakage modelling tutorial

This is a collection of scripts (now converted to notebooks) that I developed back in 2013 to understand apllication of linear regression techniques in side channel analysis.

There are definitely more aspects to leakage modelling. This tutorial covers only a limited part of it.

## Background

The tutorial is mainly inspired by the following paper:
* [Carolyn Whitnall and Elisabeth Oswald. Profiling DPA: Efficacy and efficiency trade-offs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/353)

Another paper would also help the understanding of linear regression techniques (in the non-profiled setting, which is not covered by this tutorial):
* [Victor Lomn√©, Emmanuel Prouff, and Thomas Roche. Behind the Scene of Side Channel Attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/794)

If you are completely new to side channel analysis, you would need [this book](http://dpabook.org).

The tutorial uses the same example traces and data as the [pysca toobox](https://github.com/ikizhvatov/pysca). It is intended to be a subfolder of pysca but maintained as a separate repository. The tutorial is tested with Python 3 (Anaconda distribution).

## Contents

### Building leakage models

1. [Simulation of single bit leakage](1-Simulation.ipynb). Fitting a line using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

2. [Real leakage of a single bit](2-Singlebit.ipynb). Measurements here and below come from an AES-128 implementation on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller. In addition to linear regression with OLS, we use another technique for leakage modelling: building templates.

3. [Multi-bit leakge modelling](3-Multibit.ipynb). Performing linear regression with different sets of basis functions of all the 8 bits of the target variable.

4. [Templates](4-Templates.ipynb). Building reduced templates, now for the full 8-bit values.

### Comparing leakage models

5. [Comparing leakage models](5-CompareLeakageModels.ipynb). First layer of comparison between Hamming weight and models built using linear regression and templates. Plotting the values side-by-side and computing correlation between them.

6. [Running a correlation attack](6-CompareSingleAttack.ipynb). Second layer of comparison: looking at the effect of the correlation-based distinguisher with different models plugged in.

7. [Comparing success rate](7-SuccessRate.ipynb). Running many attacks to get the ratio the of successful ones. Illustrates the point that linear regression needs less traces than template building to obtain a model that is precise enough in this case.
