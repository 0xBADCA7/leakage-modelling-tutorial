# Side channel leakage modelling tutorial

This is a collection of scripts that I developed back in 2013 to understand apllication of linear regression techniques in side channel analysis.

The tutorial is mainly inspired by the following paper:
* [Carolyn Whitnall and Elisabeth Oswald. Profiling DPA: Efficacy and efficiency trade-offs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/353)

Another paper would also help the understanding of linear regression techniques (in the non-profiled setting):
* [Victor Lomn√©, Emmanuel Prouff, and Thomas Roche. Behind the Scene of Side Channel Attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/794)

If you are completely new to side channel analysis, you would need [this book](http://dpabook.org).

The explanation and more material is coming.

The tutorial uses the same example traces and data as the Pysca toobox (https://github.com/ikizhvatov/pysca). It is intended to be a subfolder of Pysca but maintained as a separate repository.
