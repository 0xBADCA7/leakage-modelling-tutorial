# Leakage modelling tutorial

This is a collection of scripts that I developed back in 2013 to understand apllication of linear regression techniques in side channel analysis.

The tutorial uses the same example traces and data as the Pysca toobox (https://github.com/ikizhvatov/pysca). It is intended to be a subfolder of Pysca but maintained as a separate repository.
